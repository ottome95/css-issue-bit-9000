# CSS Issue Bot 9000

## Overview

Bleep bloop, please help Issue Bot 9000 solve all CSS validation errors using the W3C Jigsaw CSS validator.

## Directions

1. Open this lab in your code editor.
2. Copy the code from css/style.css and paste it into the W3C validator at: [http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) then click the large check button to check the code. Use the error messages to correct the code line by line. Save the file then re-validate the code again until all errors are gone. This will make Issue Bot 9000 very happy!

(HINT: If you'd like to take a look at your handiwork, you can preview this in your browser by right-clicking the file in the file tree, and selecting "Open in Browser" .)
